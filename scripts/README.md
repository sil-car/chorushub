## Building ChorusHub

The goal is to have a binary that can run on Ubuntu, Synology, and possibly
eventually Windows. Ideally, this will have few to no external dependencies,
which would facilitate packaging and distribution to Ubuntu and Synology.

### 1st Idea: PyInstaller binary

### 2nd Idea: Docker container

### 3rd Idea: Snap package + Synology package
